# StudentDatabaseMockUp

I have created a mock student database without an actual database to practice OOP. It has the barebones files that will enroll students and display their upper division standings.
The upper division standings will come into focus later as I will be adding a class object that will require a student to be in their upper divisions to enroll for classes that start with an id of 3 or 4.

There are many other things I will add in the future such as:
 1. Creating an actual database that will function with SQL queries.
 2. Adding a class object
 3. Adding a professor object
 4. Adding a grade object that will belong to a student.
