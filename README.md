# StudentDatabaseMockUp

I have created a mock student database without an actual database to practice OOP.
There are many other things I will add in the future such as 
 1. Creating an actual database that will function with SQL queries.
 2. Adding a class object
 3. Adding a professor object
 4. Adding a grade object that will belong to a student.
